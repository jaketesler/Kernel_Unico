##To anybody reading this, these are my personal notes and are in NO way things anybody else should do. I will make a formal README at some point with proper instructions


MODIFICATIONS
Two header files in arch/arm/mach-mx6
Modified file drm.h in include/drm/
added line in /arch/arm/mach-mx6/board-mx6q-sabresd.c
modified [static inline void mx6q_seco_UDOO_init_uart] in board-mx6_seco_UDOO.c to include more UART ports


SYSTEM
Made changes to (and added file) /etc/init/ttymxc3.conf
cmd: stty to fix baud rate of ports to 9600 [sudo stty -F /dev/ttymxc3 9600]
modified /etc/default/console-setup to include more ttys[#]

ps -ef | grep getty



TO MAKE CHANGES TO GPIO DEFAULTS:
Change the startup value of a gpio pin (input/outHigh/outLow):
-Open board-mx6sdl_seco_UDOO.h in /arch/arm/mx6 (or quad header file for that board instead)
-Move pin definition from one method to the method you want
(e.g.) move "MX6DL_PAD_GPIO_0__GPIO_MODE," from static unsigned int mx6dl_set_in_outputmode_high[] to static unsigned int mx6dl_set_in_outputmode_low[]
to change from default outHigh to outLow on boot.
[NOTE: get name of GPIO pin from the UDOO alternate pin definition table. GPIO will usually be listed under ALT5 as GPIO#_IOxx where xx is the GPIO pin you want.]

Additionally, to change the default MODE of a GPIO pin (i.e. GPIO â€”> UART instead), remove it from these methods (or comment out) and change the definition above. There are many, just uncomment the one you want and comment the previous definition. 


NOTES:
ttymxc0 : UART1
ttymxc1 : UART2 : USB
ttymxc3 : UART4+R : TXRX1



To compile kernel (in one line)
use udoo-kc

LED protoblock is on GPIO20 / GPIO17


To connect: 
ENTER: screen /dev/tty[[whatever file it is]] 115200
replace the brackets with the name of the connector
use "ls /dev/tty*" to find devices

To write to GPIO:
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpioxx/direction
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpioxx/value
